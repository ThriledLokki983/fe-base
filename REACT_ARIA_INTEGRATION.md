# React Aria Components Integration

We've integrated [React Aria Components](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/components.html) into our Frontend Base project to enhance accessibility and behavior while maintaining our luxury design system.

## What's Been Done

1. **Refactored the Select component** to use React Aria Components internally
2. **Refactored the Input component** for accessible text field functionality
3. **Maintained the existing API** for backward compatibility
4. **Enhanced styling** with states for focus, hover, and selection
5. **Added documentation** for future component integration
6. **Created templates** for new components following this pattern

## Benefits Gained

### Accessibility
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Screen reader announcements
- Keyboard navigation
- Focus management
- Proper ARIA attributes

### User Experience
- Smooth animations
- Consistent behavior across browsers
- Touch support for mobile
- Type-ahead selection
- Password visibility toggle

### Developer Experience
- Familiar API
- Strong TypeScript support
- Reduced boilerplate
- Separation of concerns (behavior vs. styling)

## Next Steps

1. **Migrate additional components** following the same pattern:
   - Button
   - Checkbox
   - RadioGroup
   - TextArea
   - Dialog
   - Tabs

2. **Enhance the build process** to optimize bundle size

3. **Add comprehensive testing** for accessibility
