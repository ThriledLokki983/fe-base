2. **Remove Complex Reducers**: Eliminate useAppStateReducer and related complexity
3. **Update Context Providers**: Simplify or remove AppStateContext
4. **Component Updates**: Update all components using old state management

### Priority 2: Security & Performance (1-2 hours)
1. **Content Security Policy**: Add CSP headers for XSS protection
2. **Bundle Analysis**: Run bundle analyzer and optimize further
3. **Compression**: Add gzip/brotli compression in production
4. **Service Worker**: Implement caching strategy

### Priority 3: Testing & Quality (2-3 hours)
1. **Component Tests**: Add comprehensive testing for critical components
2. **E2E Tests**: Implement Playwright/Cypress for user flows
3. **Accessibility Tests**: Add automated a11y testing
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Add Web Vitals tracking

## 📊 CURRENT STATUS

### Bundle Size Analysis
- **Before**: 492KB main bundle + 172KB fonts = 664KB total
- **After Route Splitting**: ~150KB initial + lazy chunks = ~300KB total (-55%)
- **Target**: <200KB initial load

### Performance Metrics
- **Lighthouse Score**: Expected improvement from 65% → 85%
- **Time to Interactive**: Expected improvement from ~2s → ~800ms
- **Largest Contentful Paint**: Expected improvement with font optimization

### Accessibility Score
- **Current Issues**: Missing focus management, incomplete ARIA support
- **Implemented**: Skip links, screen reader announcements, keyboard navigation
- **Target**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance (95%+ accessibility score)

## 🛠 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### 1. Replace Toast Component Usage
```bash
# Update MainLayout to use new ToastSimple
# Remove old Toast component references
# Test toast functionality across app
```

### 2. Migrate Components from useAppState
```bash
# Update Header component
# Update Sidebar component  
# Update any pages using app state
# Remove old context providers
```

### 3. Build and Test
```bash
yarn build
yarn preview
# Test all routes and functionality
# Verify performance improvements
```
