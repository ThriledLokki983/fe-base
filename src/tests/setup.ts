// Add any global setup for testing here
// This file runs before your tests

// Some common setup might include:
// 1. Setting up mock implementations for browser APIs
// 2. Setting up testing libraries like @testing-library/react
// 3. Setting up test environment variables

export {}; // This turns the file into a module with its own scope
